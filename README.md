# Escape-Game

•We need two players. 

•Player one runs away with keyboard arrows and player two follows the egg to click on it and kill it. 

•They can also use buttons to speedup or speed down the egg movement. 

•Speeding up can happen with the key x. 

 •The egg has 4 chances to escape and when its lives have finished the game is over.
